whog       contains information on each COG, including the COG name,
           functional classification (using a one-letter code), function 
           description, and the the list of proteins (or domains) from all 
           66 complete genomes included in the COG database.
  
myva       FASTA file containing all the proteins (or domains) from the 
           66 complete genomes, including those not included into any COG.
                     
myva=gb    The list of protein names and corresponding GI numbers.
                     
fun.txt    explains one-letter functional classification used in the COG
           database
           
org.txt    explains 3-letter abbreviations for the species represented
           in the COG database.
                  
pa         the results of BLAST for all the proteins/domains in the format:
           a - b (score p-value) astart..astop bstart..bstop,
           where a and b are protein/domain names.
