Use COGs.tar (COGs.tar.Z) to download the FASTA libraries for all COGs
Use aln.tar (aln.tar.Z) to download the ClustalW alignments for all COGs
To download s small number of COGs or alignments, it may be preferable to
use the corresponding uncompressed files.

COGs.txt   contains information on each COG, including the COG name,
           functional classification (using a one-letter code), function 
           description, and the the list of proteins (or domains) from all 
           44 complete genomes included in the COG database.
  
COGs.gene  gene name for each COG,
  
COGs/      Directory that, for each COG, contains a FASTA library 
           of all the proteins/domains included in the COG (e.g. COG0001). 
                  
aln/       clustalW alignments for each COG (e.g. COG0001.aln).
           
xyva       FASTA file containing all the proteins (or domains) from the 
           44 complete genomes, including those not included into any COG.
                     
fun.txt    explains one-letter functional classification used in the COG
           database
           
org.txt    explains one-letter and 3-letter abbreviations for the species
           represented in the COG database that are used in the phylogenetic
           patterns
                  
pa         the results of BLAST for all the proteins/domains in the format:
           a - b (score p-value) astart..astop bstart..bstop,
           where a and b are protein/domain names.
